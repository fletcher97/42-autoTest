# PISCINE TESTER

This folder contains tests for the piscine. Feel free to poke around and change
stuff as needed.

## INSTRUCTIONS

For these tests to work you should have cloned the repository into your home
folder. You simple need to copy the script `test.sh` located inside the folder with the name of the group of exercises you wish to test to the folder where you have your exercises. The file structure should look something like this:

```
Cxx/
├── ex00/
│   └── xxx.c
├── ex01/
│   └── xxx.c
...
└── test.sh
```

Once done run the command `sh test.sh`. You will get on the screen the output of
your program and the expected one. GOOD LUCK!

## DISCLAIMER

These test are not exhaustive and do not garantee that your solutions will pass
moulinette. If you find a bug please report it by creating an issue on this
project's github page.
